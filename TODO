##############################
-- Basics: functionality
##############################
-- Fill out the quantities which can be plotted in params.py
-- Fix whatever is happening with the 3D graphs
-- Add magnetic field lines on 2D const. rho plots
-- On 2D const rho plots, add option to see density heatmap vs contours. Or add contours to the heatmap? 

##############################
-- Basics: design
##############################
-- All the formatting for table in tab 1
-- Font sizes for plots
-- Plot titles + axes labels
-- Graphs in "Cross sections tab." Replace with a single row element containing the graphs so alignment is automatic.
-- Flux surfaces: find better colors, and more helpful things to show.  Also do you need to show the grid lines? 
-- Add units to all labels. 
-- Figure out how they plot the 2D, constant phi heatmaps in DESC. Improve our plots
    


##############################
-- Performance  
##############################
-- See how memory and app loading time behave with more saved equilibria. 
    -- If loading time is a problem, add dropdown with checkmarks for which equilibria the user wants loaded.


##############################
-- Overall program logic/design
##############################
-- Check if the bulk of time required to build graph is due to desc computing the data, or actual graph building. 
   -- If former, store data arrays (as .h5 files) rather than building plotly graph first.
-- The preprocess script does not need separate functions for computing each type of quantity.


##############################
-- New features
##############################
-- Load in equilibrium families. 
-- Option to click on the 2D or 3D plots and blow them up into a larger overlaid window, for closer inspection.
-- Hover over a flux surface and see basic parameters (rho, iota)
-- How much fun would it be to show trajectories of particles! 
    -- At the very least, can show a vector field of the direction of first order drift at each point.
-- Try to properly represent the magnetic axis in 3D. Probably already computed in DESC.
