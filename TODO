##############################
-- Basics: functionality
##############################
-- Fill out the quantities which can be plotted in params.py (*Low Priority*)
-- Add magnetic field lines on 2D const. rho plots
-- On 2D const rho plots, add option to see density heatmap vs contours. Or add contours to the heatmap? 
-- Hover text over the entries in the table should tell you what the variable means, and units
-- For the flux surfaces, make the grid lines constant as slider varies. 
-- Why is iota (and q) negative?


##############################
-- Basics: design
##############################
-- All the formatting for table in tab 1
-- Font sizes for plots
-- Plot titles + axes labels
-- Graphs in "Cross sections tab." Replace with a single row element containing the graphs so alignment is automatic.
-- Flux surfaces: find better colors, and more helpful things to show.  Also do you need to show the grid lines? 
-- Add units to all labels. 
-- Figure out how they plot the 2D, constant phi heatmaps in DESC. Improve our plots
-- For QS, need to allow user to specify helicity 
    


##############################
-- Performance  
##############################
-- If the 3D plots are taking up most of the memory, then you shouldn't store the same mesh over and 
   over again. Instead, just store the color map for each quantity, and build when the user loads.

-- See how memory and app loading time behave with more saved equilibria. 
    -- If loading time is a problem, add dropdown with checkmarks for which equilibria the user wants loaded.


##############################
-- Overall program logic/design
##############################
-- Check if the bulk of time required to build graph is due to desc computing the data, or actual graph building. 
   -- If former, store data arrays (as .h5 files) rather than building plotly graph first.
-- The preprocess script does not need separate functions for computing each type of quantity.


##############################
-- New features
##############################
-- Load in equilibrium families (Currently loads in only the final equilibrium in a family)
-- Option to click on the 2D or 3D plots and blow them up into a larger overlaid window, for closer inspection.
-- Hover over a flux surface and see basic parameters (rho, iota)
-- How much fun would it be to show trajectories of particles! 
    -- At the very least, can show a vector field of the direction of first order drift at each point.
-- Show Frenet frame along magnetic axis. 
    -- Could show a tubular neighborhood + coordinate system
